                            You can keep your SMART Health Card as a record of your vaccination history and/or test results. You can also choose to share it with others (such as your doctor or a specialist your doctor refers you to or schools and other venues requiring immunization for admittance) if you want or need to show them this information.

                                    You may download it from a website or app hosted by the organization and print a copy and/or save it as a file.
                                </li>
                                <li>

                            Different organizations have different rules for verifying COVID-19 vaccinations or test results. For example, some states and countries may have different rules than others. SMART Health Cards are designed so they may be used by any organization that wants to use them, for COVID-19 as well as other healthcare credentialing. All organizations should provide options for users who don't have or prefer not to use SMART Health Cards.

                            No. The SMART Health Card Framework was designed to empower individuals with access to their healthcare data in secure, easy-to-access, equitable, and privacy-preserving ways. Developed prior to the COVID-19 pandemic by researchers at public and private institutions, the creators are honored that the technology has helped organizations and people worldwide at an urgent and critical time. The power of the SMART Health Cards Framework is its open-sourced standard that can be applied to many use cases beyond COVID-19. Research and planning is currently underway for uses like childhood immunization records. Visit this Harvard Medical School article for more information about the SMART Health Cards Framework.

                            When you get an additional dose after receiving a SMART Health Card, it will not automatically reflect on your original QR code. You will need to delete your first one and then download another, which will add your additional dose(s) to your original vaccination record. It can take several weeks to get the information from your vaccination location into your state registry, so you might not see it yet if you were recently vaccinated. If you continue to have issues, you should contact the organization from whom you received your vaccination and SMART Health Card, or check with your state immunization registry. Here is a list of <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/iis/contacts-locate-records.html#state" target="_blank">state registries</a> and here is a <a href="issuers.html">list of issuers</a>.

You should only share your SMART Health Card information with trusted organizations that tell you what they intend to do with your data and/or if they will keep it. If you are not comfortable with the organization seeing the information in your SMART Health Card, you should not share it.

                            SMART Health Cards empower individuals with secure, equitable, and privacy-preserving access to their clinical information. As former Utah Governor Mike Leavitt has said about the benefit of SMART Health Cards, “I own the right to have my own data. And to have it in a form that I can present it conveniently for the kinds of things I want to do.”

                            Yes. SMART Health Cards are an open-source standard and are based on the SMART Health Card Framework. Anyone can use the SMART Health Card Framework to build solutions that verify clinical results, and organizations all over the world have already adopted these standards for that reason as well as for numerous other use cases. For instance, with iOS 15, Apple is using the SMART Health Cards Framework to allow users to download and store verifiable COVID-19 test results or vaccination records in the Health app, Walmart has announced the creation of a digital wallet for its customers to track their health information built on SMART, and in less than one year, more than 20 states and U.S. territories have launched SMART Health Cards systems by offering residents a digital record of their COVID-19 vaccination status.

An issuer is any organization authorized to generate these cards, including pharmacies, hospitals, healthcare providers, medical labs, public health agencies, and more.

                            When businesses require proof of vaccination, they need to know that the proof of vaccination they're seeing comes from a trustworthy source and is legitimate. The VCI Directory and the CommonTrust Network were developed to create this trust. These directories vet and approve potential issuers. Then, they openly publish the list of organizations that meet <a href="#What-are-data-aggregators-and-health-IT-vendors-and-what-role-do-they-play-in-vaccination-verification-with-SMART-Health-Cards">VCI's</a> standards. This ensures that only SMART Health Cards issued by reliable sources get approved when proof of vaccination is taking place, which means verifiers can have confidence in the reliability of a person's vaccination status when they're scanning a SMART Health Card.
